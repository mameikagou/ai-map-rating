The Statue of Liberty is amazing! I visited last weekend and the views were breathtaking. The ferry ride was also fun.

Times Square is always crowded but the energy is incredible. Best time to visit is late at night when all the billboards are lit up.

Central Park is my favorite spot in NYC. Great for picnics and there's always something interesting happening. The Bethesda Fountain area is particularly beautiful.
